# DeepSee
"DeepSee" implements image processing: noise addition, filtering (average, Gaussian, median), edge detection (Sobel, Roberts, Prewitt, Canny), histogram equalization, normalization, thresholding, and frequency filters. Includes RGB-to-grayscale and hybrid images. Perfect for learning computer vision.


# Getting Started with Development

1. Create the virtual Environment:
```
    python -m venv deepsee_venv 
```
2. Activate the virtual Environment:

```
    deepsee_venv\Scripts\activate 
```
3. intsall the requirements:

```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the app:

```
    python main.py
```

Freeze the requirements after installing a new package 

```
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
